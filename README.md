## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Packages Used

### Key Learnings
* **API Integration:** Deepened my understanding of asynchronous programming in Dart.
* **Refactoring:** Applied clean code principles to move from a monolithic file structure to a modular one.
* **Version Control:** Leveraged GitHub for branch management and commit history.
