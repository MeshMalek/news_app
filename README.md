## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Packages Used
* `Dio`: For making efficient API requests and handling interceptors.
* `skeletonizer`: For creating professional skeleton loading screens.
* `webview_flutter`: To open and read full articles within the app.

### Key Learnings
* **API Integration:** Deepened my understanding of asynchronous programming in Dart using Dio.
* **Refactoring:** Applied clean code principles to move from a monolithic file structure to a modular one.
* **UI/UX Enhancement:** Used `SliverFillRemaining` to center error messages and loading states perfectly.
* **Version Control:** Leveraged GitHub for branch management and commit history.
